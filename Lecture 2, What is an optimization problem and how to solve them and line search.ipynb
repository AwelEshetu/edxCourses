    "Optimal solutions to some optimization problems can be found by defining an explicit formula for it. For example, if the objective function is twice continuously differentiable and there are no constraints, the optimal solution (if exists) can be found by calculating all the zero-points of the gradient and finding the best one of those. In this kind of cases, the optimization problem **can be solved using non-iterative methods.**\n",

    "**In this course we concentrate on the iterative methods.** Iterative methods are needed, if the problem has constraints, or the problem is in some other way not-well behaved (to be defined later, depending on the context). In iterative methods, the solving the optimizaiton problem starts from a so-called starting solution and then tries to improve the solution iteratively. The optimization algorithm chooses how the solution is changed at each iteration.\n",
