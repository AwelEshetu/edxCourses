It should, but you may notice that your code runs more slowly, especially in cases with very large balances and interest rates.

One-twelfth of the original balance is a good lower bound.\n",

What we ultimately pay must be greater than what we would've paid in monthly installments, because the interest was compounded on the balance we didn't pay off each month.
